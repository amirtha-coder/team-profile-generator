## Description

This is a Node.JS application that produces a customisable readme that can be used for any project. The application requires the users to follow the installation and usage below. On load of the repository, users will be prompted with a series of questions by the inquirer package. Most questions requires an input but the license question will ask the user to select from a list of popular licenses. Once all the questions are answered a readme is generated. This GENERATED_README.md will contain the markdown for the README changes that you have specified. The markdown contains code blocks and links to the repository via the username that you have typed in. The badge alongside the project title should also alter when you select another license.
